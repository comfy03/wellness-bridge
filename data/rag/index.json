      "text": "Letter to the Editor Better Sleep Means Better Health Edward Grandi and Michael Coppola, MD E veryone knows that good health depends on a bal- anced diet and regular exercise. Far too few of us are aware that there is a third key component of good health— sufficient sleep. How sufficient sound sleep builds good health is not well understood, but recent research suggests that in the deeper stages of sleep the body releases hormones that unleash physically restorative processes. Other research suggests that during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the sleep in which we dream, our minds sort through the experiences of the day and memory consolidation occurs. When an individual gets enough sleep, it is usual to cycle 3, 4, or even 5 times each night through stages of light sleep, deep non-REM sleep, deep REM sleep, then back to light sleep, and so on. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that sleep deprivation damages vital organs (eg, heart, brain, kidneys). Ordinarily, catch-up sleep can repair the damage, but if the ‘‘sleep debt’’ persists, the damage may be irreversible. Sleep deprivation leads to daytime fatigue, and that in turn dis- courages exercise. Sleep deprivation also"

Sleep deprivation also disrupts the produc- tion of the appetite hormones leptin and gherlin. The persistent hunger that results makes overeating almost inevitable. In short, if sufficient sleep, the third member of the triad, is not in the mix, good health is unattainable. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders pre- pared by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine lists 84 conditions that interfere with sleep; the most frequent of these is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It is conservatively estimated that 22 million adults in the United States suffer from OSA, a number that is likely to increase as the popu- lation ages and the obesity epidemic worsens. Simply put, sleep apnea is repeated nighttime bouts of suffocation that fragment sleep to the point that its deeper stages do not occur, or do not occur enough.

The bigger challenge for clinicians is getting their patients to stick to the prescribed therapy, which for the more severe cases is likely to be positive air- way pressure therapy. More successful treatment and better adherence to therapy is more likely to come once OSA is recognized as a chronic disease and is managed accordingly. Effective management methods can be modeled on existing programs for diabetes, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Not surprisingly, managing OSA costs money. The money spent now should be seen as an investment in reducing the future health care costs of cardiovascular and cardiocerebral incidents, type 2 diabetes, and other comorbidities that are related to untreated sleep apnea. The time for simple research has passed. It is time to im- plement a coordinated approach to the diagnosis and treat- ment of OSA that will reach the most people. Effective management of OSA, a key component of improved sleep health, can be a major contributor to reducing the cost of health care.

Worley In the inaugural issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005), a feature article 1 traced early milestones in the devel- oping field of sleep medicine, which slowly emerged from the older field of sleep research during the 1970s and 1980s. Sleep medicine, the article noted, was closely linked with and made possible by the discovery of electrical activity in the brain. The examination of elec- troencephalogram (EEG) patterns that occur during sleep led to the classification of stages of sleep, which in turn created an important foundation for probing human sleep, discern- ing abnormalities, and discovering significant relationships between sleep and health. By 2005, scientists and clinicians had not only identified and clearly defined a large number of sleep disorders but had discovered that many of them were highly prevalent.

People have come to value time so much that sleep is often regarded as an annoying interference, a wasteful state that you enter into when you do not have enough willpower to work harder and longer.” It has become increasingly clear, however, that no matter how hectic our lives may be, we can no longer afford to ignore what research is telling us about the importance of sleep for our safety and mental and physical well-being. Impact on Attention, Cognition, and Mood While scientists are still working to iden- tify and clarify all of the functions of sleep, 12 decades of studies—many of which have used the method of disrupting sleep and examining the consequences—have confirmed that sleep is necessary for our healthy functioning and even survival. “We know for sure that sleep serves mul- tiple functions,” says Dr. Dinges. “Nature tends to be very parsimonious in that it often uses a single system or biology in multiple ways to optimize the functioning of an organism. We know, for example, that sleep is critical for waking cogni- tion––that is, for the ability to think clearly, to be vigilant and alert, and sustain attention"

We know, for example, that sleep is critical for waking cogni- tion––that is, for the ability to think clearly, to be vigilant and alert, and sustain attention. We also know that memories are consolidated during sleep, and that sleep serves a key role in emotional regulation.” Studies conducted by Dr. Dinges and other scientists have shown that cognitive performance and vigilant attention begin to decline fairly quickly after more than 16 hours of continuous wakefulness, and that sleep deficits from partial sleep depriva- tion can accumulate over time, resulting in a steady deterio- ration in alertness. The widely used psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), a simple neurocognitive test developed by Dr. Dinges and colleagues that assesses an individual’s ability to sustain attention and respond to signals in a timely manner, has proven to be an exceptionally sensitive tool for capturing dose–response effects of sleep loss on neurobehavioral func- tioning. 13 The PVT also reliably detects sleep deficits caused by disrupted or fragmented sleep, and/or poorly timed sleep, which is important because a growing body of evidence sug- gests that the conti"

Inadequate sleep also can take a toll on psychological well- being, significantly affecting our emotional and psychosocial interpretation of events and exacerbating our stress levels.

He also notes that there is still a fairly large population sleeping 6 hours or less. “Although there are signs that sleep time is increasing, it is not happening at nearly the dramatic rate that most experts would like to see,” says Dr. Dinges. “This is especially true for vulnerable populations.

Differences in performance also have been shown to be task-dependent, suggesting that people who are vulnerable to the effects of sleep loss in one or more cognitive or neu- robehavioral domains may be resistant to the effects of sleep loss in others.

To date, no viable candidates have been found. Investigators also are shedding light on the role that age may play in resilience to sleep loss. The results of one recent study indicate that younger adults are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of chronic sleep loss and recurring circadian disruption than older adults. 20 Although the neurobiological basis for these age-related differences is not yet understood, such findings may help to inform new approaches to the pre- vention of drowsy driving and related motor-vehicle accidents among young drivers.

Although approximately 70 million people in the U.S. have at least one sleep disorder, experts estimate that up to 80% of sleep disorders may go undetected or undiagnosed. One major challenge that clinicians face during the initial assessment of people with sleep disorders is the process of identifying and sorting out comorbidities. Untangling the causes and effects in bidirectional comorbidities can be particularly difficult. For example, insomnia––by far the most common sleep disorder–– often is complicated by the presence of another sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome. “Some experts have even suggested that all cases of insomnia coexist with, or are caused by, another sleep disorder, most commonly sleep apnea,” says Clete A.

Opioids, for example, are known to have adverse effects on respiration, and can lead to central sleep apnea (CSA)––shallow and irregular or interrupted breathing and sustained hypoventilation––a potentially lethal condition that can intensify the consequences of OSA. These risks underscore the need to improve methods for identifying and properly diagnosing the estimated 23.5 million U.S. adults with OSA. Public education and advocacy efforts are already helping to improve detection––in part by helping to address misconceptions about OSA. “One of the biggest misconceptions is that only people who are significantly overweight experience sleep apnea,” says Dr. Kushida. “In fact, only up to 67% of people who have OSA are overweight, the rest are of normal weight. OSA also can be caused by craniofacial dysmorphism, or a defect of the airway that occurs during development. A narrow airway caused by deficient growth of the craniofacial skeleton, particularly th"

A narrow airway caused by deficient growth of the craniofacial skeleton, particularly the jaws, can become narrower and more prone to collapse with age, leading to sleep apnea.” Treating Insomnia: The Value of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep disorder, affects approximately one third of all adults and is the most common condition that family and primary-care phy- sicians encounter. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), chronic insomnia is the inability to attain sufficient sleep (despite adequate opportunity) for at least three nights per week for three months or longer, with negative daytime consequences. For most people, the disorder is transient, but for approximately 10% to 15% of those who experience insomnia (around 30 million people) it becomes chronic. Although pharmacologic treatments for insomnia (Table 2) can be effective, most experts now recommend against the long-term use of pharmacotherapy. “If a person has been diagnosed with chronic insomnia, the only treatment that has been shown to have"

In our clinic, we commonly see that, over time, medications stop having an effect, and that means that patients may try higher doses of a medication, or keep switching to different medications. So, medications are a temporary solution––they just put a Band-Aid on the problem of insomnia, whereas cognitive behavioral therapy targets one of the pathways toward success.” Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which involves tech- niques that work in part by reducing cognitive and somatic arousal, is estimated to be effective in approximately 70% to 80% of people who experience chronic insomnia. Dr. Kushida notes that while drugs can sometimes be useful in the treat- ment of acute insomnia, they become problematic after acute insomnia transitions to chronic insomnia. “A person m"

Dr. Kushida notes that while drugs can sometimes be useful in the treat- ment of acute insomnia, they become problematic after acute insomnia transitions to chronic insomnia. “A person might be an OK sleeper for several years, and then suddenly experience a traumatic event, such as the loss of a job, a divorce, or the death of a loved one, resulting in very poor sleep,” says Dr. Kushida. “Down the road, that person might obtain a better job, overcome grief, or find a new relation- ship, but continue to experience insomnia. We think in some cases the transition from acute insomnia to chronic insomnia occurs because the behavioral event triggers something in the person’s physiology that may lead to long-term changes. Once they are in a chronic insomnia phase, we tell patients that CBT is the only truly effective intervention.” If a patient is already taking hypnotics, Dr. Kushida says that he will gradually wean the patient off medications while introducing CBT. He notes that often it is necessary for sleep specialists to manage the expectations of chronic sufferers. “We sometimes have to let patients with chronic insomnia know that we may never get them back to where t"

Our inability to completely restore the patient’s ability to sleep well may partly be explained by as yet unidentified changes in his or her neurophysiology or neurochem- istry. Some patients with chronic insomnia can begin to sleep normally again, but for the vast majority, we aim to make insomnia less of a burden on a patient’s daily life.” Improving Clinical Research In the field of sleep medicine, as in many other therapeutic areas, future directions in clinical trial research will place an emphasis on patient engagement and patient-centered outcomes. “Perhaps the most important aim these days when develop- ing and implementing any type of large-scale clinical research study is to incorporate the patient’s perspective,” says Dr. Kushida, who is currently analyzing "

It’s critical to learn from patients whether they are overwhelmed by the number of tests, or whether travel time or the amount of time they need to take off from work may be impractical.” Other efforts to improve clinical research include those focused on correcting for and/or eliminating "

The placebo effect, which refers to any outcome that may be attributable to the expectations of clinical trial participants rather than to the drug or device being tested, can be especially problematic in experimental protocols that involve self-reports of sleep quality. “Clinical trials involving patients with disorders such as insomnia or RLS that rely solely on subjective measures, or ratings of severity based on patient report, are particularly vulnerable to the placebo effect,” says Dr. Kushida. “It has been demonstrated that when these patients believe that they are receiving the study drug or device the likelihood of their experiencing a positive effect can increase significantly. There have been efforts to develop or introduce new objective endpoints in these studies, which may help with this problem.” Achieving the right balance of subjective and objective measures of sleep is an important goal in both research and clinical "

The current gold standard for objective assessment of sleep is polysomnography (PSG), which includes electrophysiologi- cal recordings of brain activity (EEG), muscle activity (EMG), and eye move- ments (EOG). A valuable, non-invasive method for determining sleep continuity and sleep architecture, PSG has been an indispensable objective endpoint in clinical trials, but it is expensive and not always practical. Novel approaches to objective measurement, including actigraphy, which may be used to help minimize recall bias and complement subjective measures of sleep (e.g., sleep logs or diaries), still have drawbacks. 24 “The problem with wearable devices right now,” says Dr. Kushida, “is that they tend to overestimate sleep, sometimes by as much as an hour. They also are not yet capable of accurately detecting different stages of sleep, such as non-REM and REM sleep.

Because of our proximity to Silicon Valley, our laboratory tests a lot of these new devices, and often by the time we have finished testing one prototype, new ones have emerged. The product cycles are rapid, and the companies keep incor- porating newer and newer technology. So, down the road, within about five to ten years, I think these devices will likely estimate sleep and detect sleep stages with precision.” Also, objective tools are needed for addressing problems with adherence to treatment. One important current aim is to detect and correct for non-obvious factors that result in failure to adhere to treat - ment, whether unintended or deliberate, to ensure that trial outcomes accurately reflect the efficacy of a drug, medical device, or behavioral intervention. 25 A related problem is deliberate deception by trial participants.

It’s important that we find a way to address these deceptive practices because both the integrity of research data and the safety of participants are at risk.” Dr. Kushida adds that newer tools, such as electronic moni- toring of pill dispensing and statistical predictive adherence models, may uncover and remedy pressing problems related to adherence and deceptive practices. “It already takes about 12 years for a new drug to be approved, and about three to five years for a new device to be approved.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd10.130081 . Sleep is an essential component of health, and its timing, duration, and quality are critical determinants of health (1). Sleep may play an important role in metabolic regulation, emotion regulation, performance, memory consolidation, brain recuperation processes, and learning (2). Because of the importance of these functions, sleep should be viewed as being as critical to health as diet and physical activity. However, public health practitioners and other health care providers have not focused major attention on the importance of sleep to health. In this essay, we briefly summarize the scientific literature about hours of sleep needed and why sleep is an important public health issue.

We also suggest areas for expanding sleep research and strategies for increasing awareness of the importance of sleep and improving sleep health. Finally, we call for action to bring sleep to the forefront of public health. How Much Sleep is Needed and Are We There? The 2006 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation indicates that the average basal sleep needs of adults is approximately 7 to 8 hours per night, and the optimal sleep duration for adolescents is 9 hours per night (1). However, more than 35% of adults report getting fewer than 7 hours of sleep during a 24-hour period (3,4), and almost 70% of high school students report getting fewer than 8 hours of sleep on an average weeknight (5). Overall, about 15 million children in the United States do not get sufficient sleep (6). Among adults, the reasons for sleep loss appear to be related mainly to lifestyle, work schedules (shift work and long hours), or sleep disorders (1). Approximately 20% of workers are engaged in shift work, which often leads to longer work hours (1). Among adolescents, insufficient sleep is ass"

Among adolescents, insufficient sleep is associated with greater use of social media technology, and among younger children it is associated with depressive symptomatology, family disagreements, and safety issues around home, school and neighborhood (6). Why Is Sleep a Public Health Issue? Insufficient sleep has major health consequences in adults, adolescents, and young children. Strong evidence exists that among adults insufficient sleep has a significant effect on numerous health conditions, including chronic disease development and incidence (1). For instance, short sleep duration (<7 hours of sleep per night) and poor sleep quality are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and metabolic disorders such as glucose intolerance, which may lead to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension (1). People who have short sleep duration are at 1.48 times greater risk of developing and dying of coronary heart disease than controls and 1.15 times more likely to have a stroke (7).

Children who experience short sleep duration are more likely to become obese than those who do not (8). Insufficient sleep also affects immunologic function and development of mood disorders and is associated with depression; deficits in cognition, memory and learning; and reduced quality of life (1). Adults who sleep fewer than 7 hours per night have greater difficulty concentrating, remembering, and performing other daily activities than those who sleep 7 to 9 hours a night (4). Children and adolescents who get insufficient sleep have impaired behavior, mood, and performance (9). One major consequence of insufficient sleep is daytime sleepiness, which reduces alertness and causes slow reaction time, leading to occupational and medical errors, workplace injuries, impaired driving, and motor vehicle accidents (1). In 2009, almost 5% of adults in 12 states reported that during the previous 30 days they had nodded off or fallen asleep while driving (3).

There are substantial public health investments in all areas related to sleep, from obesity and other chronic conditions to motor vehicle accidents. Insufficient sleep, unlike other health risk factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical inactivity, has historically received much less attention in the public health and clinical settings. Insufficient sleep is an important public health risk factor that would benefit from further investigation. Lack of Awareness Despite strong evidence of the relationship between insufficient sleep and health problems, most people are unaware of the amount of sleep they need, their level of sleep deprivation, and the negative impact of sleep deprivation on health. Because of lack of awareness, sleep is not commonly incorporated into public health approaches. In addition, many health care providers do not counsel their patients about healthy sleep habits (11). In a study of health care screening among 121 primary care clinics, only 43% included sleep-related questions on their screening batteries compared with 100% for smoking and alcohol, 93% for healthy eat"

It is not clear why sleep is not included in health screenings, but it may be related to the clinician’s lack of knowledge of the importance of sleep. In 2002, only 10% of primary care providers described their knowledge of sleep and sleep disorders as good (12). Although little evidence exists on the effectiveness of sleep screening and counseling on sleep behavior, screening and counseling has been shown to improve the health behaviors of patients in other areas, such as dietary habits, smoking cessation, and physical activity (13). Therefore, giving providers information about screening and counseling for appropriate sleep time and needs could better equip primary care and public health professionals with the knowledge needed to screen and counsel patients to promote sleep as a healthy behavior (1).

Strategies to Improve Awareness and Sleep Health Information about the physiology of sleep and sleep disorders is widely available, but much less work has been done on effective strategies to promote sleep as a healthy behavior. This field is prime for public health investigations and interventions to reduce the negative effect of insufficient sleep as a common risk factor for many health outcomes. Some suggested strategies for improving sleep initiation and sleep maintenance, duration, and quality are consistency in bedtime and rising; maintaining an appropriate sleeping environment (dark, relaxing, not too hot or cold); avoiding television -watching before bed, avoiding use of electronics or reading in the bedroom; and avoiding large meals and physical activity before going to bed (www.sleepfoundation.org).

Reaching these goals will require 1) improved public education on the need for sleep and the consequences of insufficient sleep; 2) more training for public health professionals and health care providers on screening and counseling; and 3) improved evidence of the burden of insufficient sleep acquired through surveillance and monitoring tools. Federal agencies, public health partners, and private organizations are collaborating to employ IOM strategies. For example, The National Sleep Awareness Roundtable (NSART) (www.nsart.org), a national coalition of government, professional, volunteer, and other organizations, is collaborating to raise awareness about sleep among the public, increase the understanding of the importance of sleep, and reduce the public health and safety impact of sleep deprivation and sleep disorders by improving communication and co"

Several of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s surveillance systems have added questions on sleep to provide state and national data on the burden of insufficient sleep (14–16); however, more national data are needed on young children (aged 0–12 years).
